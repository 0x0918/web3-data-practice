# web3-data-practice
This repo is for practice questions for on-chain data analysis, engineering, and science in Web3.

The organization of this repo will probably change a lot as we figure it out, but we'll start simple with just one folder and questions list

The personal tg group I'm running for this requires you to apply [here](https://ilemi.pallet.com/talent), but feel free to talk in the discussions tab.

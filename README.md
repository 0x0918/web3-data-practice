# web3-data-practice
This repo is for practice questions for on-chain data analysis, engineering, and science in Web3.

The organization of this repo will probably change a lot as we figure it out, but we'll start simple with just one folder and questions list

The personal tg group I'm running for this requires you to apply [here](https://ilemi.pallet.com/talent), but feel free to talk in the discussions tab. I'll livestream every Sunday at 10 EST to go over weekly questions and other web3 data stuff - follow along on [twitter](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYG9WSr8G4khYLaxP9tLCkQ) for updates! :)
